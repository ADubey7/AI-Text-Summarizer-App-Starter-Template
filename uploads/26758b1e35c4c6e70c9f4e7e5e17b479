"The impact of climate change on global agriculture has been a topic of intense debate among researchers. Rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events pose significant threats to food production. Studies suggest that certain regions may experience longer growing seasons, while others face severe droughts, reducing crop yields. Additionally, pests and diseases are spreading to new areas due to changing climates, further endangering food security. Mitigation efforts, such as sustainable farming practices and technological innovations, are essential to adapt to these challenges and ensure a stable food supply for the growing population."
